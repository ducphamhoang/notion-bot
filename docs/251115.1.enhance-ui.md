## 251115.1 — Chat UI Enhancement Plan

### Goals
- Modernize the chat surface with a lightweight yet premium aesthetic.
- Preserve current functionality (commands, auth modal, task cards) while elevating layout, responsiveness, and micro-interactions.
- Keep Tailwind-only styling to avoid bloating the frontend bundle.

### Inspiration Sources
1. **ai-chat-ui (GitHub)** — glass-morphism shell, dual theme support, typing indicators, quick prompt pills.
2. **Tailkits Chat UI** — responsive avatars/timestamps, floating command bar over blurred background.
3. **CodewithFaraz Tailwind Chat Collection** — split-pane layouts (WhatsApp-like), stacked message bubbles, lo-fi task cards.

### Proposed Experience
- **Shell & Layout**
  - Two-pane desktop layout: left column for conversation context/quick actions, right column for message stream; collapse to single column on <1024px.
  - Subtle gradient or glass background with soft shadows; sticky header containing title, status badge, theme switch, settings trigger.
  - Floating command input anchored with rounded corners, translucent background, shadow.

- **Messages & Data Objects**
  - Message bubbles with avatars, role labels, and color-coded backgrounds (user = indigo gradient, bot = slate glass, error = rose outline).
  - Task payloads rendered as upgraded `TaskCard`: accent border by status, status chip, truncated description, CTA row (view in Notion, mark done).
  - Animated entry (fade+translate) and timestamp placement under each bubble; show delivery/processing indicator near latest assistant response.

- **Interactions & Feedback**
  - Typing indicator with bouncing dots when backend is streaming.
  - Quick command chips (e.g., `/task list`, `/task assign`) above the input for discoverability.
  - Settings modal restyled as a sheet with tabs (API key, workspace info) and iconography.
  - Theme toggle (system/light/dark) persisted via local storage.

### Implementation Notes
1. **Layout Refactor** — Update `ChatContainer` to manage two-pane responsive grid (Tailwind `lg:grid-cols-[280px,1fr]`). Abstract header into its own component for clarity.
2. **Design Tokens** — Extend Tailwind config with gradients, glass colors, and box-shadow presets; ensure dark-mode variants exist.
3. **Message Components** — Introduce avatar component, role badge, and animation utilities (e.g., `transition-all`, `animate-slide-up`).
4. **TaskCard Upgrade** — Add status chip, CTA buttons, and responsive stacking.
5. **Command Bar** — Wrap `CommandInput` in a floating container, add quick chips, typing indicator, and improved disabled state.
6. **Settings Sheet** — Reuse existing modal logic but restyle with layered background, tab buttons, and close icon.
7. **Accessibility** — Maintain sufficient contrast, focus outlines, and aria labels for interactive controls.

### Validation
- Snapshot new layout on desktop + mobile breakpoints (Chrome device toolbar).
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` for regressions.
- Smoke-test commands, auth modal, and task rendering after styling changes.
